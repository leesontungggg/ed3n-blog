# Now is 2:21 AM 30/09/2019, the day after Fx Tour in Saigon 29/9.

Unbelievable, It's been 1 month since the day Fx Tour started. We have been gone through 7 cities.

We have met 9000 people.

We have performed 9 shows.

And now the tour is over, I'm very happy now, but also a little bit of sadness because I can't go other cities every weekend, to meet new people with my favourite kind of music.

I was very scared at the first day of the tour, I thought that I wasn't enough skills to help the band. I can feel the pressure is very hard.

Hanoi and Saigon were hardest parts of the tour. Because before us, Doãn Hoài Nam and Mạc Mai Sương performed firstly. So the stage at that time was very messy. I need to remove all the unnesssary stuffs and replace with CHH's gear very quickly. I just had 15 minutes to do all that stuff with high speed and high carefulness. Calm down was the secret of mine at that time. I had time. Luckily, I did my job great. All the signals is available. Entire stuffs after that was easy then. I just standed at the corner to watch over the band whenever they had a problem.

Saigon yesterday was really amazing, 2500 people.

From 6:00 PM the gate was open, until 7:30 PM the stadium was full.

I met Huu Nguyen. She came very early. I don't why she looked more handsome than me. I promised that I would drive her home after the show. I wanted her to be safe.

At 8:30PM, CHH was ready to be onstage, the crowd's energy seem like want to explode the stadium. They remember all the lyrics of every single song.

OMG, the paper firework with the plastic balls was so funny. It made the atmosphere became hotter and the energy boosted up much more. 

When the show was over, people was still shouting CHH name while the band was back to the room.

Touring is extremyly funny. I wish I could stand as a musician of a stage like that.

Thank you All Access for helping CHH to achieve one of their dream.

P/s: I'm developing a new feature in my blog, you can drag the picture to other location. This will help me with a lot of idea in the future.
