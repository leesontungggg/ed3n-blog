# Hi, this is Eden.

Today I passed the Internship phase at Designveloper, I moved to Probation phase for more 2 months.

The employer told me that my level is `Junior - 1`.

And I will get paid `6.300.000 vnđ` for Probation time & `7.000.000 vnđ` after probation.

Hmm, I don't know. I think that this payment `isn't very good` for me.

But for now, `I have no job`, and I `need money` for bills.

And `I love the guitar application` that I'm working on.

My plan is that I will continue working on this application as long as learning more about guitar. This is a good oppurtinity.

For end of this year, I have `some core items` that I need to achieve:

1. New Macbook Pro 17 ( like new also good) : `30.000.000 vnđ`
2. Mixer Zoom LiveTrak L-20 : `23.000.000 vnđ `
3. Studio Monitor Rokit R8: `14.000.000 vnđ `

So totally I need more :` 67.000.000 vnđ` for my music and audio engineering career.

If I continue working in Designveloper I will get `20.000.000 vnđ` to the end of this year.

So I need about `47.000.000 vnđ` more.

Okayyyyy, let think about how to get it tomorrow. 

I'm tired.
