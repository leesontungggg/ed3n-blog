# Today is Friday, 27/9/2019

Today was a funny day. I worked exactly like a technical guy of the band.

In previous show, I feel like I wasn't exactly a tech guy of the band because all the part was handled by Mr Hoang.

Phước recognized my bass experience and he gave me a chance to tune the bass for the FOH.

I didn't know if they EQ like I said or not. But the importance here is that Mr Phuoc believe in me.

And an other important is that the mix, the audio of Tram band recorded with out me, was mastered by me last night.

I  think I will make the audio sound better tomorrow.

Now I need to continue preparing for tommorrow.

Ps: 1/11 I will come to Ha Noi again for Monsoon Festtttttttt. Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. Hyukoh wait for meeeeeeeeeee.
