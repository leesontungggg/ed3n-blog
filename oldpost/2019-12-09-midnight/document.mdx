# Now is 11:33PM 9/12/2019.

Since more than 1 months from my last blog. Due to the domain problem, I can't connect to my blog at that time.

Today I want to write some lines for my favourite artist, his name is Tim Bergling aka `Avicii`.

I first listened to Tim's music in 2014, when I was a first year student. At that time, I didn't have any idea what I was doing, I listened to all kind of music and didn't have a favourite genre.

So when I was playing FIFA Online at a gaming room, I randomly played an album from www.chiasenhac.com named `TRUE` because of a beautiful artwork. Although I played the game, but my body is still moving to thee music of Tim. The melody was awesome and beautiful.

After that, I followed Avicii on all of my socials channels. I looped his songs for days and introduced his music to friends.

I watched his videos also, and I could see he's highly focus when he making the music, and whenever he found a good melody, he smiled.

I extremely liked Avicii. I changed my profile picture, my bio, my background, everything into Avicii icon.

I was learning Swedish to have more chance to come to Sweden to see him in real. He also made me love Sweden a lot. It's a beautiful country.

I hoped that oneday I will have enough money to fly to UMF or Ibiza to listen him live.

I always wish that dream. But that dream will never become `TRUE`.

Tim has rested in peace forever.

Tim has gone to his `HEAVEN`

It's on 20 April 2018 in Oman.

I was shock. I couldn't belive the truth but I had to stay with that. I can't see him in reality anymore.

I quitted learning Swedish after his death.

He left us a huge legacy, a lot of beautiful melodies that unfinish.

Tim's friends helped him to finish these beautiful melodies into an album named `TIM` release on 2019.

In 5th December 2019, in Stockholm Sweden. A concert was held to tribute to Tim. The most special thing is All the music was played by a band, musical instrumental. Carl Falk, a friend of Tim, said `Me and Tim, we used to talk about love, talk about fear, and we talk about dream. And we have this one dream about starting a band, that write sone and play them live with live instrument and in front of live body. Here we are. We did it, Tim.`

The band played 29 tracks of Avicii including Wake me up, Waiting for live, The Nights, Levels, ... with the live instrument with sound nearest to the original.

I will embed the video here again.

I feel goosebump every single songs of the concert. I cried a lot for the hard working of the team, for the music, for the love from the audience.

I have splitted the audio into multiple tracks to upload to my soundcloud. Because I want to loop the music whenever I want, and for the people who also love Avicii music.

I want to say thank you for all the people involve in making the concert happened. You guys did it.

Avicii, I love you.
