I've `designed this typo some minutes ago`.

I've also `set up the git for studio225december.com website`.

I will `continue the design for it to be better on Friday`.

I think that maybe I will quit the current job to follow my passion about this.

Maybe it a little hard. But I will try to.

Maybe `next month I won't have 7.000.000 vnÄ‘`.

But ` I will have free time to do all the things I want to prepare for the studio be the best`.
