</div>

This is the quote from my experience.

30 minutes before, I was at the office of Designveloper. I told the HR manager that `I want to quit the current job`.

The main reason is about timing. The company is using `HubStaff`, a time tracking for dev.

I used it for 2 or 3 days, then I went crazy about of it. It tracked all of my time, take screenshot of my computer.

I `don't have any freedom` when using it. 

Beside of that, I `need to login enough 7 hours a day`.

I `can't handle time for that. I need to go on tour, I have a lot of things to manage`.

So I decide to quit the current job.

I am `job-less now`.

So to survive in the next months, I am being a Technology guy of CHH & Information Manager for AIESEC.

It has been a long time since my last work for AIESEC. 

This time I will `get a payment from AIESEC`. About `100$ a month`. Enough for me to eat. That's good.

Another `income will come from the benefit of the studio`. 

Incoming times will be very hard. I `need to very focus` and `hard working` to achieve all the things that I wish.

Yeahhhhh, enough for the quitting-job-stories.

I just go to my firebase console, to clean up the projects.

I saw `huunguyen-blog analytics` one, the `usage is available`.

<img src= {require('./analytic.jpg')} style={{width: 630}}/>

I `hope that the people who is using the blog is Huu Nguyen`.

Next step I will use `Flutter to build CHH application`. Because it will be the same design on Ios an Android.

I need to learn it now. Byee.
