Recently, my Mac Mini 2014 has been become laggy and slowly, it's always running of ram, and the speed of the cpu is pretty slow too ( 4th-generation, 1.4-GHz Intel Core i5 processor ).

Due to my heavy workload as a freelancer, I need a stronger Mac. Personally, I feel that the Macbook Pro is pretty expensive for me. I can't afford that. So I decide to look into Hackintosh.

What is **Hackintosh** ?

    A Hackintosh, is a computer that runs an Apple Macintosh operating system on computer hardware not authorized for the purpose by Apple.

I have so special requirements:

1. Dual boot with Windows.
2. Run a simulator a long the way with the IDE.
3. Enough RAM to compose the music with Logic X Pro.

From these requirements, I choose to go with **Ryzen 5 3600**.

After doing a lot of research, I choose AMD CPU due to the number of cores & threads with a very good price ( 4.200.000 VND ).

The geekbench of the Hackintosh is

And the geekbench of the Macbook Pro 15 inch 2018

The Hackintosh geekbench is higher than Macbook Pro. And about the price, I paid **13 mils VND** for the Hackintosh. While the price of the Macbook Pro 15 inch 2018 Core i9 is about **45 mils**.

I think Hackintosh save me a lot of money depsite its inconvenience. Now I can focus more than content & skills much more than the system anymore.
