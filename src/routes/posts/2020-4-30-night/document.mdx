Dear my beloved Lele,

Happy birthday to your father !

Unfortunately, I don't have a gift for him.

But I have a gift for his daughter.

The gift is the backpack that contains this letter.

I bought this 2 years ago.

But I rarely used it.

I’m not fit with the style of the bag.

I saved it for other purpose.

It's made from 95% original leather, 4% of Cu, 1% iron.

Today, I moved all my furniture back to my hometown.

I saw it.

And immediately, in my head, the best suitable person for this bag is you, princess.

Today is Independence day, also your father’s birthday,
I want to send this as a gift to you.

Hope you have a beautiful holiday,
as you are.

Love,
Eden.
