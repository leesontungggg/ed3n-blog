Loving you is the most beatiful thing in my life. And of course, I am suffering the most challenging emotions, feelings.

I miss you a lot. I care you a lot. Even you don't realize that.

You want to free as a bird. I am following you as a horse.

When we had problems, miscom. You ignored me. I was very sad. I cried.

That's my own problems. You don't care about that.

You are 25 now. You can stand your responsibility.

You know that, I know that.

Then you can choose your own path. You don't want me to care about that. Then I'll follow your words.
