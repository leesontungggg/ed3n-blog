Recently, I am feeling interested in Terminal Working Space more than the normal IDEs.

The main reasons why I switch to Terminal:

+ More efficent for large systems - Try opening a VS solution with a 100 projects and 10,000 files.

+ Simpler for a lot of tasks, you edit in one window, run make in another, have gdb in a third.

+ Easier to automate tasks, often easier to work in teams or cross-platform if everyone has gcc and vi (or emacs)

Also, as far as command-line editors go, they can be run on the command-line when you don't have access to an environment with a GUI, so there are plenty of situations where that flexibility is a big plus.

Although the setup steps is pretty complicated and takes a lot of time, the productive is higher.

Happy to learn more about the terminal editor.
