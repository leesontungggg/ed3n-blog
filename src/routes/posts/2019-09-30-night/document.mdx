# Now is 11:48PM PM 30/09/2019.

I've just finished my meeting with Sang about AIESEC's IM team.

This morning was a long day, I moved all my stuff to new place.

I need to say goodbye to room 509, which I have stayed for 9 months.

<ZoomImg

  src={require("./IMG_0765.JPG")}
  style={{ marginTop: 100, marginBottom: 100 }}
/>

And I say hello to room 201, a bigger room that I will use it for my studio.

<ZoomImg
  imageWidth={600}
  src={require("./IMG_0760.JPG")}
  style={{ marginTop: 100, marginBottom: 100 }}
/>

Room 201 is about 45 m2, much more biggeer than my previous room.

The window over there. I will use it for setting up the background for photo shooting.

The combo of background I will need to pay about 7.000.000 vnd. It will be done in 10/10.

I am finding a place for setting up the table for music making in the room.

Anyway, today there were something special appears.

Ming uploaded to his instagram the picture which I took for him. And he said thank you. That make me really touching. Thank you for believe in me, Ming.

And this

<ZoomImg

  src={require("./kamao 1.jpg")}
  style={{ marginTop: 100, marginBottom: 100 }}
/>

This was taken by random guy when I was smiling to Mother 5 ( Má Năm ). I don't know his name. I just know that he came with Chu Ba Dat Maniac.

<ZoomImg
          imageWidth={600}
          src={require("./kamao 2.jpg")}
          style={{marginTop: 100, marginBottom : 100}}
/>

This was also taken by him. Great Photographer.

Staying alone in a big room is pretty lonely. I don't know what to do now. Maybe I should go to sleep.

Good bye.
