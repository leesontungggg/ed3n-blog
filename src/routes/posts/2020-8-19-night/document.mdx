    Right from the start, she didn't need my appearance in her life, did it? 

I don't want to ask her the stupid question like that. Because it's totally not important. At least in our situation. But it's important to me. I don't know that the hell am I doing. Is it correct? Is it wrong?

    I don't know.

She totally is the girl who could make me to change. I get better everyday.

The thing is that I was very willful, I was assumed that she would fall for my love, my passion.

I'm pretty sure that I'm not the guy who can make her to change.

Then it means that she doesn't need my appearance in her life.

So the question is 

    What the hell am I doing in her life? She doesn't need me. 

# But I need her.

# What should I do ???? Please please please.
