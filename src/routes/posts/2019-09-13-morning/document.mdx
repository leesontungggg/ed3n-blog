Currently I am on the bus with Cá Hồi Hoang to travel to Cần Thơ for the performance tonight.

This is 4th city in Fx Tour Summer 2019.

I'm happy to be a part of Cá Hồi Hoang. It makes me feel comfortable about my life.

I mean that to be travel & prepare for performance is a beautiful part of my youth.

I love composing music but I think I'm not enough skills to do it for now.

By the way, the idea of building my own studio still appears in my head. I can't take it off. Maybe it's a good idea to achieve for the 22.5 December Studio one.

Okay, it's some of the thought appear in the morning in my head.

See you tonight after the show!
