# Now is 20:37PM 10/10/2019.

It's been 10 days since my last blog. 

In that 10 days, I've suffered a lot of intersting feeling.

  1. At Phieu Concert, a music concert held by UAH ( Đại học kiến trúc ), there were a lot of artists there. I saw a band. Actually about 1 year ago, this band was at the same position as Trầm band. And then, they became artists at Phiêu. It's a really big change. Then I was asking myself " What is the difference between they and us that they can stand on a stage like that and Trầm band can not ?". I have some answers for my question. 
    - They compose music. They sing their songs in their styles.
    - They don't sing popular song.
    - They don't receive wedding show. 

  I really want to became an artist that can stand on that stage. Sing my songs. 

  2. I am thinking about inviting Mr Doan Hoai Nam for my first artist for a Live Session named "225 December". He will come  to Saigon on 19/10.
  This is really good chance for me because I have a good relationship with Doan Hoai Nam. His songs are also very nice. Catchy.
  Maybe "225 December" Live Session  will look similar to COLORS Live Session. Example below.

  3. I have paid 10.000.000 vnđ for the Motor and backgrounds. This step make me really hesitant. Because if I pay this, I will need to work much more harder. Because I have a lot of dreams.
  This is really interesting. Anyway, incoming time will be challenging. 

  4. Today, I taken my first picture at my studio. It's a picture of my guitar with yellow background. This make me feel really happy. I feel like an really artist.

That's some of mines. This life is interesting right ? =)))

Aww, 1 more point. I've received a design from Huu Nguyen for my studio. This look pretty nice. I love the idea.

The picture describe a guy, who is coding, composing, mixing, at the same time. This picture is really me =)). I will print this and put this on the wall of my studio.
Thanks Huu Nguyen.
