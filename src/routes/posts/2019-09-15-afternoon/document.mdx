# Good afternoon

Yesterday I didn't write any blog due to because I didn't have enough time to do it.

So for now, I will recap for my experience of Fx Tour in Cần Thơ.

This is all the gears that we brought for the performance.


We came to Cần Tơ at 9:30 AM. Then we went for lunch. Phước has found a very famous local restaurent. The food was vert awesome.

The `address of the restaurent is 54 Trần Bình Trọng str`. I will come back to this place is I have a chance to come to Cần Thơ again.

After having lunch, artists came back to the hostel for relax. I come along with Mr Hoang to the venue for preparing, monitor the speaker, stand by everything.

At 2:30PM, Artists came to the stage for sound check.

I can see this venue is bad for Artist because there's no monitor for front-man and all the monitor stand behind front of house. Artist needed to used the amplifier for monitor of their guitar.

And they `don't have any monitor for vocals`. This is `really bad when you're not hearing what you're singing`.

Anyway, guitars sounded good enough to make the crowd jump.

At 6:00PM, when everything is fine, I came with Mr Hoàng for a break. I learnt a lession from him about definition of sound.

He said: "`Sound is the change of the pressure in the atmosphere. Sound change when the pressure change.`"

In my opinion, this is `the most basic explaination of sound`. I usually explain sound base on Frequency, Vibrato. But they are all highly definition of sound.

We `came back to the venue at 7:00 PM for standby`.

Below is the stage of the performe that night.

The audience is about `200 people`. Maybe it's not enough to fill all the space, but the enery they bring to the show is amazing. Cần Thơ is super energetic for the first time.

`At 7:45, the show starts`. Artist came to the stage & burn the nighttttttttt.

Unfortunately, after the first song, Luke's `guitar was broken on the 3rd string`.

I came immediately to Ming to ask if he brought other pack of strings. Luckily he did.

I jump to Luke, get his guitar, and go to backstage.

I have to say that expensive pack of string is complicated of recognizing the size of string. 

It took me the `most time to get the 3rd string` to replace.

Leo told me that `with Holo body guitar`, I `need to turn the string 3 rounds firstly before tuning the string`.

One more lesson for that. Then I gave back the guitar to Luke.

After GAP, time to welcome Đạt Maniac to the stage.

Đạt always know `how to bring the best energy to the crowd`. `Everybody go crazy` because of the appearance of him.

Because this is the first time to Cần Thơ, so in Beertalks, instead of playing the singing game, Thành introduce the band to everybody.

The music show ends with `one of biggest hits` of CHH -> "Tầng Thượng 102"

`Cần Thơ was so Awesome`.

After the show, we go back to the hostel by `All Access` cars.

All Access is awesome alsooooo.
