# Hi -> Eden

I've passed my 23th birthday 8 days ago.

When I was a 20s guy. I was being scared of getting older whenever I looked at my brothers, my mentors. 

Actually, It's not that scary. I feel myself grow up much more. And the ages is the thing we must pay for being grow-up.

I was scare of being job-less, no-money, no-achievement. But now it is. 

I'm job-less now. I don't have any achievement also. All my plan of my youth collapsed.

And the point is I have to accept the current situation. Simply because I was still on the way of discovering my self, the limitation of it.

### ==> That's me -> a pure sagittarus.

Today I learnt one thing which I think it is the most important point I need to learn.

## Meaning of La La Land in my opinion

I watched La La Land when I was 20. I was so naive at that time so I don't what the meaning of that ending scene.

Until recently, after some love & career problems in my life. I think I understand that ending scene a little bit more.

People usually like each others base on the first impression. People usually fall in love base on the special emotion that they bring to each others.

But love is not the point to bring their relationship to marriage.

Nowaday, the safety is the highest elements to bring people into marriage.

Nowaday, when everything is measured by money, by benefits, love is no longer the core value to bring each others to be together.

Sebastian was so. He was still on the way of discovering himself. No money, still running outside everynight, playing the same boring songs everyday. No money, job-less ( in a society-view ), loser in life.

He was loving Mia so much. But he knew Mia didn't belong to him. 

Mia also had her dreams. Mia also need the enviroment to grow. Mia need to move to other place to develop her career. Mia also needed a husband who can take care of her child for a better future.

Unfortunaly, Sebastian didn't have any values of that.

But Sebastian made Mia feel the same heart beat. Their emotion for eachother is beautiful. The love was pure.

More than anyone else, they know their love will be the most beautiful love of their life. Of course they want to marry each other too.

The daily discussions between them about their passion, their dreams. Their plan to achieve their dream complict to the other's plan.

They need the space for each other to grow. They know that. They're the birds, and they're horse also.

They have their own sky and their own moutain to run and fly.

And the adventure they bring to each other so beautiful, because both of them love discovering them self.

If you love someone, you don't need to keep them beside of you. You need to let them fly, do whatever they want.

If they truly belong to you, It will do itself. The earth have it own way of operation. Your life can be a brand new story tomorrow. Our life mission is discovering Who Am I ?

By the way, more 20 mins will be my ex-girl friends birthday. It's 27/12.

Until now, maybe she is the girl bring me the most beautiful emotion in my life. Thank you.

And Happy Birthday, Huu Nguyen !
