The first idea of 22.5 December is a live session music & a little bit of photo shooting and rent.

I don't know.

Maybe I'm so `greedy`, I want more. I have a lot of ideas :

 - Photoshooting

 - Live Session Record

 - Film shooting 

 - Renting

 - Music Production

 - Record Studio

`I feel like I want to take all of this at a time`.

`This is not good`.

I want to build this place as a photo shooting first.

And `renting to pay for monthly bills`.

That's the first plan & I will stay with it.

I also want to `compose music`. But this will be in `another place. another time, when everything is at its position`.

So basically, the `studio225december.com will be the main channel for marketing` renting first.

`After 3 month` of renting, I will `put this into a live session channel`.
