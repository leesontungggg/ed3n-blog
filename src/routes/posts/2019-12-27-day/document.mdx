The idea that we’re workers and that we need to trade our time for a salary is an outdated model.

`Etymology /ˌedəˈmäləjē/ : Etymology is the study of the history of words. By extension, the phrase "the etymology of [some word]" means the origin of the particular word.`

Passive income allows you to transcend the archaic model of trading your time and effort for money. It allows you to generate that same money (if not more) with zero effort and outside the bounds of a traditional time constraint.

`Capital: vốn`

A lot of you might be thinking, “But what if I’m too late for the party?”
The short answer here is, “No.”

I won’t go too in-depth into this idea in this article (for I already have in another), but all you really need is 1,000 True Fans (as noted in Kevin Kelly’s groundbreaking article, “1,000 True Fans”).

The idea is simple — in order to sustain a viable business, all you need are 1,000 True Fans (or people that will come for your products and services over and over) that can help you generate $100 individually, thus providing you with $100,000.

In other words, you’re only going to need to capture 1,000 people out of the 209.6 million that are online shopping.

Put another way — you only need .0004771% of the entire market in order to generate $100,000 annual revenue through this model!

Step 1: Develop an idea that helps a community solve a problem

This doesn’t even need to be an original idea — you can take an already successful existing idea in the marketplace, add your spin on it, and make it better.
Facebook is the best example we have of someone taking an already existing idea and making it better.

Step 2: Build a digital “brick & mortar” so you have a place to launch your products/services

If you’re going to sell a product or service to an audience, you’re going to need a place from which to sell them.
Enter your blog/site.
Blogging is an industry that we used to think of as a joke some 10 years ago. Now, it’s a goldmine that has people entering the space daily.
When you own a domain and site, you have a place from which to store and sell your products. You need this in order to build a successful passive income machine.

Step 3: Use an ESP to sell your products on auto-pilot

An Email Service Provider is the most crucial tool you’ll use in order to make your product building and selling efforts go on autopilot.
With email, you have the means for direct contact with your audience and direct means to pitch and sell them new products as you develop them.
You can have someone join your email list and set into motion the automated sequences that will provide them value and sell them your products/services.
