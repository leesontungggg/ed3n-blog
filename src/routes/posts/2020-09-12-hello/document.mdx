# Hey how are you ?

Today is a good day for me.

There're some ideas that come up to my mind during the day.

1. I can rent a bigger room for building a studio inside. The price of a bigger room ( 32m2 ) is `6.200.000 vnd` .I can handle that by myself. But I need more tools like the background, the flash light. I need my friend help for controling the room.


2. I can earn money by letting the studio being rent. maybe 100/h is good. So for basically, If I doing this part good, `I will have the money for paying my rent` . It's goooood.

3. I want to make a website for learning with guitar. with Web Audio & React. `This maybe the start of Audio Processing Part of 326 Engineering.`


Okay Today I just wring some ideas down. That's all.

Good night, Eden.
