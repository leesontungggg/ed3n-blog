# Today is Monday, 23/9/2019

I've just came back from Da Nang

`Fx Tour has finished 6/7 cities`.

Next `Saturday will be the last one in Fx Tour`. I can't wait for next Saturday.

`Fx Tour in Hue & Da Nang was good`. The sound was great. Audience was great. Band played awesome. That's enough for a good performance.

In Da Nang, `I met Pat, a friend that I haven't seen since LASC`.

She took me to a lot of place in Da Nang.

Da Nang is called "City of Bridges" because there're multiple Bridges there.

I love the `"Tan Phuoc" bridge the most because it has a ocean scene, very romantic & beautiful`. This brige `lead us to Son Tra Moutain`.

I really want to `celebrate my wedding there`.

And on the airplane that back to HCMC, I have an idea about `building CHH application that connect the band & the audience more effective`.

The`app will be done in October`, that I said to Phuoc.

I also have an other Idea of `building an online virtual recorder that instantly sharing their music to other people or a team`.

That's main keyword ideas I have for today.
