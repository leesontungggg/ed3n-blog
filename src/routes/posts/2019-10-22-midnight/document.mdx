# Now is 12:30AM 23/10/2019.

I'm alone at the studio. Just waken up at 10:30PM I guess, I can't sleep now.

Recently, I feel myself very messy. I mean messy in my mind. I don't know what to do next.

I get back to playing computers game. I don't know why. But I think I need something to make me more relax.I was stressful.

Most of the things that make me feel stress is about my next steps, my dreams, money, bills.

It's 23 days since I moved to this place. I still don't have any good products.

I am asking my self this question non-stop : `How to live a life that balance everything ?`

I found something pretty interesting: `Lagom Life Style`.

It means “Not too little. Not too much. Just right.”

[Lagom: How The Swedish Philosophy For Living a Balanced, Happy Life Can Help You Live a Meaningful Life](https://medium.com/thrive-global/lagom-the-swedish-philosophy-for-living-a-happy-life-might-just-help-you-live-a-more-balanced-and-9bed612b4f7c)

After reading this article, I can see myself too greedy. I take a lot of works. I work really hard. But no smart. That's the points.

Lagom told me that I don't need to achieve the thing I want. I need to achieve the things I really need. No more, no less.

I don't need to buy the lastest MacbookPro 2019, I just need a Macbook Pro 2017 for rendering and remote working. 

I don't need to buy 1000$ Camera, I just need to buy a camera that can take Full HD picture, with trigger. No more no less.

I don't need to buy iPhone 11 Pro Max. I just need to buy a phone that can take off the green screen. 

I don't need to work on the fanpage of 22.5 Studio, I have my friend doing that instead of me.

I don't need to be awesome all the time. I just need to be myself, don't angry, just be calm all the time.

This life is hard. I can say it for now.


Going to Sweden was always my dream until now. Last year, I was very keen on learning Swedish for coming to Sweden. I was on 25 days streaks or someting. That's really good. I don't remember why I left that habit. I need to get that habit back to me.

I want to learn more about Sweden again. Along with that, I also want to practice more about Guitar. Incoming time, Mr Trung will come back to Nha Trang soon, I will in charge for playing Guitars.

Reminders is a really good tools for helping me at this. I can remind me everyday at a specific time for my learning habits.


I know this life is hard, but this life is interesting also. Walking this life alone is a little bit of sadness. I believe in love. I'm always looking for someone that I can feel trusted. I wish when I was exhausted, there's somebody cook for me a meal. What I need inside that meal is not about food, it's about the energy and love in that. 

I will try to finish the studio225december.com in this week for a better production view.

It's 1:00AM now, I need to prepare my luggage to go to Da Nang at 4:00AM later.
