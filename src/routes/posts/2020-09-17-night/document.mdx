I've just came back from band's practice tonight. Today we practiced in new room on `Cong Hoa Street`. The room is pretty new, everything sound good. There's one problems. `I don't like the music sheet` But I need to respect the people who arrange that. So I will continue playing that music sheet.

Anyway, in this post I will say about some new idea I have about 22.5 December studio.

If I just use the studio for photograph shooting, movie recording. I think I won't have enough money to pay for the bills per month.

So I have came up with an idea of making the Technology Review.

Yeah, you guess it right !!!

I will do it the same like `Vật vờ Studio`. This is `the biggest technology review in Vietnam`. But the problem with them is that they speak English in their video.

That will make their channel can't reach the world.

But I have to say that their content is very good. Their technology is up to date also.

Every product they review is latest one. That's good. 

And the problem is that `They don't have any stable viewer`.

`The Verge is one of the biggest technology review` nowaday.

So now I want to `recap all the idea` I have to studio :

    1. Photograph shotting
    2. Music Live Session recording
    3. Movie recording
    4. Music Producer Studio 
    5. Live Show
    6. Technology review

{/* Current 5 ideas of mine. */}

I will `public the studio225december.com domain for renting` on `this Friday`.

I also will `think about the way to marketing` this renting to other people.
