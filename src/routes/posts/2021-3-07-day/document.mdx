Dear my beloved Lele,

On Woman International day, every woman deserve to be loved.

And more than that, you are the woman of my life.

And that's pity that I can't be your side at this special day. 

I wish up on the star that I can be at Hanoi, to show you all the love that I save for you.

To show that you're the woman of my life.


Hope you like the wildsunflower.

    Eden
    Lele's future groom.
